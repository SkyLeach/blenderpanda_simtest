#ConfigVariable vfs-case-sensitive:
  vfs-case-sensitive 1  # (default value)

#Set this true to make the VirtualFileSystem present the native OS-provided filesystem as if it were a case-sensitive file system, even if it is not (e.g. on Windows).  This variable has no effect if the native filesystem is already case-sensitive, and it has no effect on mounted multifile systems, which are always case-sensitive.
#ConfigVariable vfs-implicit-pz:
  vfs-implicit-pz 1  # (default value)

#When this is true, the VirtualFileSystem will pretend a named file exists even if it doesn't, as long as a filename with the same name and the additional extension .pz does exist.  In this case, the VirtualFileSystem will implicitly open the .pz file and decompress it on-the-fly.
#ConfigVariable vfs-implicit-mf:
  vfs-implicit-mf 0  # (default value)

#When this is true, the VirtualFileSystem will automatically mount multifiles on-the-fly when they are used as directories.  For instance, opening the file /c/files/foo.mf/dirname/mytex.jpg will implicitly retrieve a file named 'dirname/mytex.jpg' within the multifile /c/files/foo.mf, even if the multifile has not already been mounted.  This makes all of your multifiles act like directories.

#Set this true to allow the transforming of soft-skinned animated vertices via hardware, if supported, or false always to perform the vertex animation via software within Panda.  If you have a card that supports this, and your scene does not contain too many vertices already, this can provide a performance boost by offloading some work from your CPU onto your graphics card.  It may also help by reducing the bandwidth necessary on your computer's bus.  However, in some cases it may actually reduce performance.

#Configure this true to compute the SSL random seed early on in the application (specifically, when the libpandaexpress library is loaded), or false to defer this until it is actually needed (which will be the first time you open an https connection or otherwise use encryption services).  You can also call HTTPClient::init_random_seed() to do this when you are ready.  The issue is that on Windows, OpenSSL will attempt to randomize its seed by crawling through the entire heap of allocated memory, which can be extremely large in a Panda application, especially if you have already opened a window and started rendering; and so this can take as much as 30 seconds or more.  For this reason it is best to initialize the random seed at startup, when the application is still very small.

#ConfigVariable http-max-connect-count:
  http-max-connect-count 10  # (default value)

#This is the maximum number of times to try reconnecting to the server on any one document attempt.  This is just a failsafe to prevent the code from attempting runaway connections; this limit should never be reached in practice.
#ConfigVariable tcp-header-size:
  tcp-header-size 2  # (default value)

#Specifies the number of bytes to use to specify the datagram length when writing a datagram on a TCP stream.  This may be 0, 2, or 4.  The server and client must agree on this value.

This can automatically ensure that your lighting normals are unit-length, which may be particularly necessary in the presence of scales in the scene graph.  Turning it off ('none') may produce a small performance benefit.
#ConfigVariable uniquify-matrix:
  uniquify-matrix 1  # (default value)

#Set this true to look up arbitrary 4x4 transform matrices in the cache, to ensure that two differently-computed transforms that happen to encode the same matrix will be collapsed into a single pointer.

#ConfigVariable fake-view-frustum-cull:
  fake-view-frustum-cull 0  # (default value)

#Set this true to cause culling to be performed by rendering the object in red wireframe, rather than actually culling it.  This helps make culling errors obvious.  This variable only has an effect when Panda is not compiled for a release build.
#ConfigVariable clip-plane-cull:
  clip-plane-cull 1  # (default value)

#This is normally true; set it false to disable culling of objects that are completely behind one or more clip planes (primarily useful for debugging)  This also disables the use of occluders.
#ConfigVariable allow-portal-cull:

#Set this true to enable portal clipping.  This will enable the renderer to cull more objects that are clipped if not in the current list of portals.  This is still somewhat experimental.
#ConfigVariable debug-portal-cull:
  debug-portal-cull 0  # (default value)

#Set this true to allow unrelated NodePaths (that is, nodes which have no common ancestor) to be adjusted relative to each other.  If true, these will be treated as if they had a common node above their top nodes.
#ConfigVariable paranoid-compose:
  paranoid-compose 0  # (default value)

#ConfigVariable paranoid-const:
  paranoid-const 0  # (default value)

#Set this true to double-check that nothing is inappropriately modifying the supposedly const structures like RenderState, RenderAttrib, TransformState, and RenderEffect.  This has no effect if NDEBUG is defined.
#ConfigVariable auto-break-cycles:
  auto-break-cycles 1  # (default value)

#Set this true to automatically detect and break reference-count cycles in the TransformState and RenderState caches.  When this is false, you must explicitly call TransformState.clear_cache() from time to time to prevent gradual memory bloat.

  garbage-collect-states 1  # (default value)

#Set this true to defer destruction of TransformState and RenderState objects until the end of the frame (or whenever TransformState::garbage_collect() and RenderState::garbage_collect() are called).  This is a particularly useful thing to do when using multiple threads, because it improves parallelization.
#ConfigVariable garbage-collect-states-rate:
  garbage-collect-states-rate 1.0  # (default value)

#The fraction of the total number of TransformStates (or RenderStates, or whatever) that are processed with each garbage collection step.  Setting this smaller than 1.0 will collect fewer states each frame, which may require less processing time, but risks getting unstable cache performance if states accumulate faster than they can be cleaned up.
#ConfigVariable transform-cache:
  transform-cache 1  # (default value)

#Set this true to enable the cache of TransformState objects.  Using the cache saves time computing transforms and inverse transforms, but imposes some overhead for maintaining the cache itself.

#Set this true to ensure that equivalent RenderStates are pointerwise equal.  This may improve caching performance, but also adds additional overhead to maintain the cache, including the need to check for a composition cycle in the cache.  It is highly recommended to keep this on.
#ConfigVariable uniquify-attribs:
  uniquify-attribs 1  # (default value)

#Set this true to ensure that equivalent RenderAttribs are pointerwise equal.  This may improve caching performance, but also adds additional overhead to maintain the cache, including the need to check for a composition cycle in the cache.
#ConfigVariable retransform-sprites:
  retransform-sprites 1  # (default value)

#To render sprite-based particle effects, Panda must convert the sprite points from object space into clip space, and compute the corners of the quads in clip space.  When this variable is false, the resulting quads are then sent to the graphics hardware in clip space.  When this is true, the quads are re-transformed back into the original object space, which is necessary in order for fog to work correctly on the sprites.
#ConfigVariable depth-offset-decals:
  depth-offset-decals 1  # (default value)

#Set this true to allow decals to be implemented via the advanced depth offset feature, if supported, instead of via the traditional (and slower) two-pass approach.  This is currently the only method by which decals are implemented in Panda3D, and as such, this setting is ignored.
#ConfigVariable max-collect-vertices:
  max-collect-vertices 65534  # (default value)

#Specifies the maximum number of vertices that are allowed to be accumulated into any one GeomVertexData structure as a result of collecting objects together during a flatten operation.  This prevents the accidental generation of large vertex buffers from lots of smaller vertex buffers, while not imposing a limit on the original size of any one GeomVertexData structure.
#ConfigVariable max-collect-indices:
  max-collect-indices 65535  # (default value)

#Specifies the maximum number of vertex indices that are allowed to be accumulated into any one GeomPrimitive as a result of collecting objects together during a flatten operation.  This prevents the accidental generation of large index buffers from lots of smaller index buffers, while not imposing a limit on the original size of any one GeomPrimitive.
#ConfigVariable premunge-data:
  premunge-data 1  # (default value)

#Set this true to preconvert vertex data at model load time to match the data requirements of the current GSG.  For instance, color columns are pre-converted to match OpenGL or DirectX encoding requirements, as appropriate.  When this is false, the data will be munged at render time instead.
#ConfigVariable preserve-geom-nodes:
  preserve-geom-nodes 0  # (default value)

#This specifies the default value for the "preserved" flag on every GeomNode created.  When this is true, GeomNodes will not be flattened, so setting this true effectively disables the use of flatten to combine GeomNodes.
#ConfigVariable flatten-geoms:
  flatten-geoms 1  # (default value)

#When this is true (the default), NodePath::flatten_strong() and flatten_medium() will attempt to combine multiple Geoms into as few Geoms as possible, by combing GeomVertexDatas and then unifying.  Setting this false disables this behavior, so that NodePath flatten operations will only reduce nodes.  This affects only the NodePath interfaces; you may still make the lower-level SceneGraphReducer calls directly.
#ConfigVariable max-lenses:
  max-lenses 100  # (default value)

#Specifies an upper limit on the maximum number of lenses and the maximum lens index number) that may be associated with a single LensNode.  There is no technical reason for this limitation, but very large numbers are probably a mistake, so this can be used as a simple sanity check.  Set it larger or smaller to suit your needs.
#ConfigVariable polylight-info:
  polylight-info 0  # (default value)

#Set this true to view some info statements regarding the polylight. It is helpful for debugging.
#ConfigVariable show-vertex-animation:

#ConfigVariable show-transparency:
  show-transparency 0  # (default value)

#Set this true to flash any objects that are rendered in some transparency mode.  The color chosen is based on the  particular transparency mode in effect.  This only has effect when NDEBUG is not defined.

#Set this true to flash any objects that use M_dual, for debugging.
#ConfigVariable allow-live-flatten:
  allow-live-flatten 1  # (default value)

#Set this true to allow the use of flatten_strong() or any variant on a node that is attached to a live scene graph node, or false to disallow this.  Flattening a live scene graph node can cause problems when threading is enabled.  This variable only has an effect when Panda is not compiled for a release build.

#If true, uses the incorrect normal vector calculation that was used in Panda3D versions 1.9.0 and earlier.  If false, uses the correct calculation.  For backward compatibility, the default value is true in 1.9 releases, and false in Panda3D 1.10.0 and above.
#ConfigVariable stm-use-hexagonal-layout:

#Set this to true to use a hexagonal vertex layout. This approximates the heightfield in a better way, however the CLOD transitions might be visible due to the vertices not matching exactly.
#ConfigVariable stm-max-chunk-count:
  stm-max-chunk-count 2048  # (default value)

#Controls the maximum amount of chunks the Terrain can display. If you use a high LOD, you might have to increment this value. The lower this value is the less data has to be transferred to the GPU.
#ConfigVariable stm-max-views:
  stm-max-views 8  # (default value)

#Controls the maximum amount of different views the Terrain can be rendered with. Each camera rendering the terrain corresponds to a view. Lowering this value will reduce the data that has to be transferred to the GPU.
#ConfigVariable stm-heightfield-minfilter:

#Default severity of this notify category
#ConfigVariable compress-channels:

#Set this true to enable lossy compression of animation channels when writing to the bam file.  This serves to reduce the size of the bam file only; it does not reduce the memory footprint of the channels when the bam file is loaded.
#ConfigVariable compress-chan-quality:
  compress-chan-quality 95  # (default value)

#The quality level is an integer number that generally ranges between 0 and 100, where smaller numbers indicate greater compression at the cost of quality, and larger numbers indicate higher quality but less compression.  Generally, 95 is the highest useful value; values between 95 and 100 produce substantially larger, but not substantially better, output files.  This is akin to the JPEG compression level.
#ConfigVariable read-compressed-channels:
  read-compressed-channels 1  # (default value)

#Set this false to disable reading of compressed animation channels, even if the decompression code is available.  The only reason you might want to do this would be to speed load time when you don't care about what the animation looks like.
#ConfigVariable interpolate-frames:
  interpolate-frames 0  # (default value)

#Set this true to interpolate character animations between frames, or false to hold each frame until the next one is ready.  This can also be changed on a per-character basis with PartBundle::set_frame_blend_flag().
#ConfigVariable restore-initial-pose:
  restore-initial-pose 1  # (default value)

#When this is true, setting all control effects on an Actor to 0 causes it to return to its default, unanimated pose.  When false, it retains whatever its last-computed pose was (which may or may not be the default pose).
#ConfigVariable async-bind-priority:
  async-bind-priority 100  # (default value)

#This specifies the priority assign to an asynchronous bind task when it is requested via PartBundle::load_bind_anim().

#ConfigVariable anim-blend-type:
  anim-blend-type normalized_linear  # (default value)

#If pstats-threaded-write is true, this specifies the maximum number of packets (generally, frames of data) that may be queued up for the thread to process.  If this is large, the writer thread may fall behind and the output of PStats will lag.  Keep this small to drop missed packets on the floor instead, and ensure that the frame data does not grow stale.
#ConfigVariable pstats-tcp-ratio:
  pstats-tcp-ratio 0.01  # (default value)

#This specifies the ratio of frame update messages that are eligible for UDP that are sent via TCP instead.  It does not count messages that are too large for UDP and must be sent via TCP anyway.  1.0 means all messages are sent TCP; 0.0 means all are sent UDP.
#ConfigVariable pstats-host:
  pstats-host localhost  # (default value)
#ConfigVariable pstats-port:
  pstats-port 5185  # (default value)
#ConfigVariable pstats-target-frame-rate:
  pstats-target-frame-rate 30.0  # (default value)

#Specify the target frame rate to highlight on the PStats graph.  This frame rate is marked with a different-colored line; otherwise, this setting has no effect.
#ConfigVariable pstats-gpu-timing:
  pstats-gpu-timing 0  # (default value)

#Set this true to query the graphics library for the actual time that graphics operations take to execute on the video card.  Enabling this will harm performance, but this information can be more useful than the regular Draw information in tracking down bottlenecks, because the CPU-based Draw collectors only measure how long it takes for the API call to complete, which is not usually an accurate reflectino of how long the actual operation takes on the video card.
#ConfigVariable pstats-scroll-mode:
  pstats-scroll-mode 1  # (default value)
#ConfigVariable pstats-history:
  pstats-history 60.0  # (default value)
#ConfigVariable pstats-average-time:
  pstats-average-time 3.0  # (default value)
#ConfigVariable pstats-mem-other:
  pstats-mem-other 1  # (default value)

#Set this true to collect memory categories smaller than 0.1% of the total into a single "Other" category, or false to show each nonzero memory category.
#ConfigVariable notify-level-char:
  notify-level-char # unspecified  (default value)

#Default severity of this notify category
#ConfigVariable even-animation:
  even-animation 0  # (default value)

#When this is true, characters' vertices will be recomputed every frame, whether they need it or not.  This will tend to balance out the frame rate so that it is more uniformly slow.  The default is to compute vertices only when they need to be computed, which can lead to an uneven frame rate.
#ConfigVariable notify-level-collide:
  notify-level-collide # unspecified  (default value)

#Default severity of this notify category
#ConfigVariable respect-prev-transform:
  respect-prev-transform 0  # (default value)

#Set this true to have all CollisionTraversers in the world respect the previous frame's transform (position) for a given object when determining motion for collision tests.  If this is false, you must explicitly enable motion detection for a particular traverser.  It is false by default to force programmers to decide on a case-by-case basis whether they really need this feature.
#ConfigVariable respect-effective-normal:
  respect-effective-normal 1  # (default value)

#This should be true to support the effective_normal interface of polygons.  Set it false to disable this feature, so that all collision solids (including polygons and planes) use their actual normal for intersection and physics tests.
#ConfigVariable allow-collider-multiple:
  allow-collider-multiple 0  # (default value)

#Set this true to enable the use of a DoubleBitMask or QuadBitMask to manage many colliders added to a single traverser in one pass.  If this is false, a one-word BitMask is always used instead, which is faster per pass, but may require more passes.
#ConfigVariable flatten-collision-nodes:
  flatten-collision-nodes 0  # (default value)

#Set this true to allow NodePath::flatten_medium() and flatten_strong() to combine multiple CollisionNodes into a single CollisionNode--but only if they share the same name and collide masks.  When false, CollisionNodes are never combined.  This is false by default, since collision tests rely heavily on bounding volume tests to be efficient, and combining CollisionNodes is likely to merge bounding volumes inappropriately.
#ConfigVariable collision-parabola-bounds-threshold:
  collision-parabola-bounds-threshold 10.0  # (default value)

#This is the threshold size for a CollisionParabola to make a bounding box (BoundingHexahedron).  If the parabola is smaller than this, it will make a BoundingSphere instead, which is much easier to make and will be good enough for small parabolas.
#ConfigVariable collision-parabola-bounds-sample:
  collision-parabola-bounds-sample 10  # (default value)

#This is the number of points along a CollisionParabola to sample in order to determine an accurate bounding box.
#ConfigVariable fluid-cap-amount:
  fluid-cap-amount 100  # (default value)

#ensures that fluid pos doesn't check beyond X feet
#ConfigVariable pushers-horizontal:
  pushers-horizontal 0  # (default value)

#Set this true to make all CollisionHandlerPushers have the set_horizontal() flag by default, false to let the move in three dimensions by default.
#ConfigVariable notify-level-device:
  notify-level-device # unspecified  (default value)

#Default severity of this notify category
#ConfigVariable asynchronous-clients:
  asynchronous-clients 1  # (default value)
#ConfigVariable notify-level-dgraph:
  notify-level-dgraph # unspecified  (default value)

#Default severity of this notify category
#ConfigVariable notify-level-display:
  notify-level-display # unspecified  (default value)

#Default severity of this notify category
#ConfigVariable notify-level-gsg:
  notify-level-gsg # unspecified  (default value)

#Default severity of this notify category
#ConfigVariable view-frustum-cull:
  view-frustum-cull 1  # (default value)

#This is normally true; set it false to disable view-frustum culling (primarily useful for debugging).
#ConfigVariable pstats-unused-states:
  pstats-unused-states 0  # (default value)

#Set this true to show the number of unused states in the pstats graph for TransformState and RenderState counts.  This adds a bit of per-frame overhead to count these things up.
#ConfigVariable threading-model:
  threading-model   # (default value)

#This is the default threading model to use for new windows.  Use empty string for single-threaded, or something like "cull/draw" for a 3-stage pipeline.  See GraphicsEngine::set_threading_model(). EXPERIMENTAL and incomplete, do not use this!
#ConfigVariable allow-nonpipeline-threads:
  allow-nonpipeline-threads 0  # (default value)

#This variable should only be set true for debugging or development purposes.  When true, the threading-model variable may specify a threaded pipeline mode, even if pipelining is not compiled in.  This will certainly result in erroneous behavior, and quite likely will cause a crash.  Do not set this unless you know what you are doing.
#ConfigVariable auto-flip:
  auto-flip 0  # (default value)

#This indicates the initial setting of the auto-flip flag.  Set it true to cause render_frame() to flip all the windows before it returns (in single-threaded mode only), or false to wait until an explicit call to flip_frame() or the next render_frame().  Setting it true gets more immediate response time, while setting it false can get a better frame rate as more is achieved in parallel with the graphics card.
#ConfigVariable sync-flip:
  sync-flip 0  # (default value)

#Set this true to attempt to flip all windows at the same time, or false to flip each window as late as possible.  Setting this false can improve parallelization.  This is a temporary variable; it will later be replaced with a more explicit control over synchronizing window flip.
#ConfigVariable yield-timeslice:
  yield-timeslice 0  # (default value)

#Set this true to yield the timeslice at the end of the frame to be more polite to other applications that are trying to run.
#ConfigVariable subprocess-window-max-wait:
  subprocess-window-max-wait 0.2  # (default value)

#This is the amount of time, in seconds, that the SubprocessWindow will wait in begin_flip for the parent process to remove the previously-rendered frame.  When this time is exceeded, the next frame will be rendered without having flipped the previous one.  This is designed to allow the Python process some time to run even when the parent window is offscreen or minimized.
#ConfigVariable screenshot-filename:
  screenshot-filename %~p-%a-%b-%d-%H-%M-%S-%Y-%~f.%~e  # (default value)

#This specifies the filename pattern to be used to generate screenshots captured via save_screenshot_default().  See DisplayRegion::save_screenshot().
#ConfigVariable screenshot-extension:
  screenshot-extension jpg  # (default value)

#DConfig
#ConfigVariable prefer-texture-buffer:
  prefer-texture-buffer 1  # (default value)

#Set this true to make GraphicsOutput::make_texture_buffer() always try to create an offscreen buffer supporting render-to-texture, if the graphics card claims to be able to support this feature.  If the graphics card cannot support this feature, this option is ignored.  This is usually the fastest way to render to a texture, and it presumably does not consume any additional framebuffer memory over a copy-to-texture operation (since the texture and the buffer share the same memory).
#ConfigVariable prefer-parasite-buffer:
  prefer-parasite-buffer 0  # (default value)

#Set this true to make GraphicsOutput::make_texture_buffer() try to create a ParasiteBuffer before it tries to create an offscreen buffer (assuming it could not create a direct render buffer for some reason).  This may reduce your graphics card memory requirements by sharing memory with the framebuffer, but it can cause problems if the user subsequently resizes the window smaller than the buffer.
#ConfigVariable force-parasite-buffer:
  force-parasite-buffer 0  # (default value)

#Set this true to make GraphicsOutput::make_texture_buffer() really strongly prefer ParasiteBuffers over conventional offscreen buffers.  With this set, it will create a ParasiteBuffer every time an offscreen buffer is requested, even if this means reducing the buffer size to fit within the window.  The only exceptions are for buffers that, by their nature, really cannot use ParasiteBuffers (like depth textures).  You might set this true if you don't trust your graphics driver's support for offscreen buffers.
#ConfigVariable prefer-single-buffer:
  prefer-single-buffer 1  # (default value)

#Set this true to make GraphicsOutput::make_render_texture() first try to create a single-buffered offscreen buffer, before falling back to a double-buffered one (or whatever kind the source window has).  This is true by default to reduce waste of framebuffer memory, but you might get a performance benefit by setting it to false (since in that case the buffer can share a graphics context with the window).
#ConfigVariable max-texture-stages:
  max-texture-stages -1  # (default value)

#Set this to a positive integer to limit the number of texture stages reported by the GSG.  This can be used to limit the amount of multitexturing Panda will attempt to use.  If this is zero or less, the GSG will report its honest number of texture stages, allowing Panda the full use of the graphics card; if it is 1 or more, then Panda will never allow more than this number of texture stages simultaneously, regardless of what the GSG says it can do.
#ConfigVariable max-color-targets:
  max-color-targets -1  # (default value)

#Set this to a positive integer to limit the number of color targets reported by the GSG.  This can be used to limit the amount of render targets Panda will attempt to use.  If this is zero or less, the GSG will report its honest number of color targets, allowing Panda the full use of the graphics card; if it is 1 or more, then Panda will never allow more than this number of color targets simultaneously, regardless of what the GSG says it can do.
#ConfigVariable support-render-texture:
  support-render-texture 1  # (default value)

#Set this true allow use of the render-to-a-texture feature, if it is supported by your graphics card.  Without this enabled, offscreen renders will be copied to a texture instead of directly rendered there.
#ConfigVariable support-rescale-normal:
  support-rescale-normal 1  # (default value)

#Set this true to allow use of the rescale-normal feature, if it is supported by your graphics card.  This allows lighting normals to be uniformly counter-scaled, instead of re-normalized, in the presence of a uniform scale, which should in principle be a bit faster.  This feature is only supported by the OpenGL API.
#ConfigVariable support-stencil:
  support-stencil 1  # (default value)

#Set this true to allow use of the stencil buffer, if it is supported by your graphics card.  If this is false, stencil buffer support will not be enabled, even if it is supported.  Generally, only very old cards do not support some kind of stencil buffer operations; but it is also not supported by our tinydisplay renderer.  The main reason to set this false is to test your code in the absence of stencil buffer support.
#ConfigVariable copy-texture-inverted:
  copy-texture-inverted 0  # (default value)

#Set this true to indicate that the GSG in use will invert textures when it performs a framebuffer-to-texture copy operation, or false to indicate that it does the right thing.  If this is not set, the default behavior is determined by the GSG's internal logic.
#ConfigVariable window-inverted:
  window-inverted 0  # (default value)

#Set this true to create all windows with the inverted flag set, so that they will render upside-down and backwards.  Normally this is useful only for debugging.
#ConfigVariable red-blue-stereo:
  red-blue-stereo 0  # (default value)

#Set this true to create windows with red-blue stereo mode enabled by default, if the framebuffer does not support true stereo rendering.
#ConfigVariable red-blue-stereo-colors:
  red-blue-stereo-colors red cyan  # (default value)

#This defines the color channels that are used for the left and right eye, respectively, for red-blue-stereo mode.  This should be a two-word string, where each word is one of 'red', 'blue', 'green', 'cyan', 'magenta', 'yellow', or 'alpha', or a union of two or more words separated by a vertical pipe (|).
#ConfigVariable side-by-side-stereo:
  side-by-side-stereo 0  # (default value)

#Set this true to create windows with side-by-side stereo mode enabled by default, if the framebuffer does not support true stereo rendering.
#ConfigVariable sbs-left-dimensions:
  sbs-left-dimensions 0.0 0.5 0.0 1.0  # (default value)

#Defines the default region of the window that is used for the left eye, when side-by-side stereo is enabled.  This is a set of four numbers, in the form left right top bottom, similar to a normal DisplayRegion layout.
#ConfigVariable sbs-right-dimensions:
  sbs-right-dimensions 0.5 1.0 0.0 1.0  # (default value)

#Defines the default region of the window that is used for the right eye, when side-by-side stereo is enabled.  This is a set of four numbers, in the form left right top bottom, similar to a normal DisplayRegion layout.
#ConfigVariable swap-eyes:
  swap-eyes 0  # (default value)

#Set this true to reverse the left and right channel output of stereo DisplayRegions.
#ConfigVariable default-stereo-camera:
  default-stereo-camera 1  # (default value)

#When this is true, the default DisplayRegion created for a window or buffer with the stereo property will be a StereoDisplayRegion, which activates the stereo properties of the camera lens, and enables stereo.  Set this false to require StereoDisplayRegions to be created explicitly.
#ConfigVariable color-scale-via-lighting:
  color-scale-via-lighting 1  # (default value)

#When this is true, Panda will try to implement ColorAttribs and ColorScaleAttribs using the lighting interface, by creating a default material and/or an ambient light if necessary, even if lighting is ostensibly disabled.  This avoids the need to munge the vertex data to change each vertex's color.  Set this false to avoid this trickery, so that lighting is only enabled when the application specifically enables it.  See also alpha-scale-via-texture.
#ConfigVariable alpha-scale-via-texture:
  alpha-scale-via-texture 1  # (default value)

#When this is true, Panda will try to implement ColorScaleAttribs that affect alpha by creating an additional Texture layer over the geometry with a uniform alpha scale applied everywhere, if there is at least one available Texture slot available on the multitexture pipeline.  Set this false to avoid this trickery, so that texturing is only enabled when the application specifically enables it.  See also color-scale-via-lighting.
#ConfigVariable allow-incomplete-render:
  allow-incomplete-render 1  # (default value)

#When this is true, the frame may be rendered even if some of the geometry in the scene has been paged out, or if the textures are unavailable.  The nonresident geometry and textures will be rendered as soon as they can be read from disk, which may be several frames in the future.  When this is false, geometry is always paged in immediately when needed, holding up the frame render if necessary.
#ConfigVariable old-alpha-blend:
  old-alpha-blend 0  # (default value)

#Set this to true to enable the old alpha blending behavior from Panda 1.9 in which the alpha value written out to the framebuffer is squared.  The new behavior is more intuitive when compositing an semitransparent image produced using render-to-texture.  You should generally leave this false unless you have an effect that relies on the old behavior, or you suspect an implementation bug.
#ConfigVariable undecorated:
  undecorated 0  # (default value)

#This specifies the default value of the 'undecorated' window property.  When this is true, the default window is created without a title bar or resizable border.
#ConfigVariable win-fixed-size:
  win-fixed-size #f  (from )
  win-fixed-size 0  # (default value)

#This specifies the default value of the 'fixed_size' window property.  When this is true, the default window is created without a resizable border.
#ConfigVariable cursor-hidden:
  cursor-hidden 0  # (default value)
#ConfigVariable icon-filename:
  icon-filename   # (default value)
#ConfigVariable cursor-filename:
  cursor-filename   # (default value)
#ConfigVariable z-order:
  z-order normal  # (default value)
#ConfigVariable window-title:
  window-title S.I.M.  (from )
  window-title Panda  # (default value)
#ConfigVariable parent-window-handle:
  parent-window-handle 0  # (default value)

#The window handle of the parent window to attach the Panda window to, for the purposes of creating an embedded window.  This is an HWND on Windows, or the NSWindow pointer or XWindow pointer converted to an integer, on OSX and X11.
#ConfigVariable win-unexposed-draw:
  win-unexposed-draw 1  # (default value)

#Specifies the default setting of GraphicsWindow::set_unexposed_draw().  See that method for more information.
#ConfigVariable subprocess-window:
  subprocess-window   # (default value)

#The filename of a SubprocessWindowBuffer's temporary mmap file, used for opening a window in a child process and rendering to a different window in the parent process.  This is specifically used for OSX when the plugin is compiled, and is not used or needed in other environments.  See WindowProperties::set_subprocess_window().
#ConfigVariable framebuffer-mode:
  framebuffer-mode   # (default value)

#No longer has any effect.  Do not use.
#ConfigVariable framebuffer-multisample:
  framebuffer-multisample 1  (from )
  framebuffer-multisample 0  # (default value)

#True if FM_multisample should be added to the default framebuffer properties, which requests a multisample-capable display, if possible.  This can be used to implement full-screen antialiasing.
#ConfigVariable framebuffer-depth:
  framebuffer-depth 1  # (default value)

#True if FM_depth should be added to the default framebuffer properties, which requests a depth buffer.
#ConfigVariable framebuffer-alpha:
  framebuffer-alpha 1  # (default value)

#True if FM_alpha should be added to the default framebuffer properties, which requests an alpha channel if possible.
#ConfigVariable framebuffer-stencil:
  framebuffer-stencil 0  # (default value)

#True if FM_stencil should be added to the default framebuffer properties, which requests an stencil buffer if possible.
#ConfigVariable framebuffer-accum:
  framebuffer-accum 0  # (default value)

#True if FM_accum should be added to the default framebuffer properties, which requests an accumulator buffer if possible.
#ConfigVariable framebuffer-stereo:
  framebuffer-stereo 0  # (default value)

#True if FM_stereo should be added to the default framebuffer properties, which requests a stereo-capable display, if supported by the graphics driver.
#ConfigVariable framebuffer-srgb:
  framebuffer-srgb 0  # (default value)

#Set this to request an sRGB framebuffer, which will convert all values to linear space before blending.  This means that the output will be properly gamma-corrected, as long as all the input textures are either converted from original sRGB to linear or sRGB textures are used.
#ConfigVariable framebuffer-float:
  framebuffer-float 0  # (default value)

#Set this to request a framebuffer that uses floating-point storage for the color channel.
#ConfigVariable accum-bits:
  accum-bits 0  # (default value)

#The minimum number of accumulator buffer bits requested.
#ConfigVariable back-buffers:
  back-buffers 1  # (default value)

#The default number of back buffers requested.
#ConfigVariable pixel-zoom:
  pixel-zoom 1.0  # (default value)

#The default pixel_zoom factor for new windows.
#ConfigVariable shadow-depth-bits:
  shadow-depth-bits 24  # (default value)

#The minimum number of depth buffer bits requested when rendering shadow maps.  Set this to 32 for more depth resolution in shadow maps.
#ConfigVariable background-color:
  background-color 0.41 0.41 0.41 0.0  # (default value)

#Specifies the rgb(a) value of the default background color for a new window or offscreen buffer.
#ConfigVariable sync-video:
  sync-video #f  (from )
  sync-video 1  # (default value)

#Configure this true to request the rendering to sync to the video refresh, or false to let your frame rate go as high as it can, irrespective of the video refresh.  Usually you want this true, but it may be useful to set it false during development for a cheesy estimate of scene complexity.  Some drivers may ignore this request.
#ConfigVariable notify-level-pipeline:
  notify-level-pipeline # unspecified  (default value)

#Default severity of this notify category
#ConfigVariable notify-level-thread:
  notify-level-thread # unspecified  (default value)

#Default severity of this notify category
#ConfigVariable support-threads:
  support-threads 1  # (default value)

#Set this false to disallow the creation of threads using Panda's Thread interface, even if threading support is compiled in.  This does not affect the operation of mutexes and other synchronization primitives, just the creation of threads.
#ConfigVariable name-deleted-mutexes:
  name-deleted-mutexes 0  # (default value)

#Set this true to allocate a name to each Mutex object that destructs, so if the Mutex is locked after destruction, we can print out its name to aid debugging.  This is only available when compiled with DEBUG_THREADS.  Enabling this variable will cause a memory leak, so you should only enable it when you are specifically tracking down an operation on a deleted Mutex.  It is not guaranteed to work, of course, because the memory for a deleted Mutex may become reused for some other purpose.
#ConfigVariable thread-stack-size:
  thread-stack-size 4194304  # (default value)

#Specifies the minimum size, in bytes, of the stack that will be created for each newly-created thread.  Not all thread implementations respect this value.
#ConfigVariable notify-level-event:
  notify-level-event # unspecified  (default value)

#Default severity of this notify category
#ConfigVariable notify-level-task:
  notify-level-task # unspecified  (default value)

#Default severity of this notify category
#ConfigVariable notify-level-gobj:
  notify-level-gobj # unspecified  (default value)

#Default severity of this notify category
#ConfigVariable notify-level-shader:
  notify-level-shader # unspecified  (default value)

#Default severity of this notify category
#ConfigVariable max-texture-dimension:
  max-texture-dimension -1  # (default value)

#Set this to the maximum size a texture is allowed to be in either dimension.  This is generally intended as a simple way to restrict texture sizes for limited graphics cards.  When this is greater than zero, each texture image loaded from a file (but only those loaded from a file) will be automatically scaled down, if necessary, so that neither dimension is larger than this value.  If this is less than zero, the size limit is taken from the primary GSG.  If this is exactly zero, there is no limit.
#ConfigVariable texture-scale:
  texture-scale 1.0  # (default value)

#This is a global scale factor that is applied to each texture as it is loaded from disk.  For instance, a value of 0.5 will reduce each texture to one-half its size in each dimension.  This scale factor is applied before textures-power-2 or max-texture-dimension.
#ConfigVariable texture-scale-limit:
  texture-scale-limit 4  # (default value)

#This specifies the limit below which texture-scale will not reduce a texture image.  This is a single dimension which applies to both X and Y.
#ConfigVariable exclude-texture-scale:
  exclude-texture-scale   # (default value)

#This is a list of glob patterns for texture filenames (excluding the directory part of the filename, but including the extension); for instance, 'digits_*.png'.  Any texture filenames that match one of these patterns will not be affected by max-texture-dimension or texture-scale.
#ConfigVariable keep-texture-ram:
  keep-texture-ram 0  # (default value)

#Set this to true to retain the ram image for each texture after it has been prepared with the GSG.  This will allow the texture to be prepared with multiple GSG's, or to be re-prepared later after it is explicitly released from the GSG, without having to reread the texture image from disk; but it will consume memory somewhat wastefully.
#ConfigVariable driver-compress-textures:
  driver-compress-textures 0  # (default value)

#Set this true to ask the graphics driver to compress textures, rather than compressing them in-memory first.  Depending on your graphics driver, you may or may not get better performance or results by setting this true.  Setting it true may also allow you to take advantage of some exotic compression algorithm other than DXT1/3/5 that your graphics driver supports, but which is unknown to Panda.  If the libsquish library is not compiled into Panda, textures cannot be compressed in-memory, and will always be handed to the graphics driver, regardless of this setting.
#ConfigVariable driver-generate-mipmaps:
  driver-generate-mipmaps 1  # (default value)

#Set this true to use the hardware to generate mipmaps automatically in all cases, if supported.  Set it false to generate mipmaps in software when possible.
#ConfigVariable vertex-buffers:
  vertex-buffers 1  # (default value)

#Set this true to allow the use of vertex buffers (or buffer objects, as OpenGL dubs them) for rendering vertex data.  This can greatly improve rendering performance on higher-end graphics cards, at the cost of some additional graphics memory (which might otherwise be used for textures or offscreen buffers).  On lower-end graphics cards this will make little or no difference.
#ConfigVariable vertex-arrays:
  vertex-arrays 1  # (default value)

#Set this true to allow the use of vertex arrays for rendering OpenGL vertex data.  This, or vertex buffers, is the normal way of issuing vertices ever since OpenGL 1.1, and you almost always want to have this set to true.  However, some very buggy graphics drivers may have problems handling vertex arrays correctly, so if you are experiencing problems you might try setting this to false.  If this is false, Panda will fall back to using immediate-mode commands like glVertex3f(), etc., to issue the vertices, which is potentially much slower than vertex arrays.  Setting this false also disables vertex buffers, effectively ignoring the setting of the vertex-buffers variable (since vertex buffers are a special case of vertex arrays in OpenGL).  This variable is normally not enabled in a production build.  This has no effect on DirectX rendering.
#ConfigVariable display-lists:
  display-lists 0  # (default value)

#Set this true to allow the use of OpenGL display lists for rendering static geometry.  On some systems, this can result in a performance improvement over vertex buffers alone; on other systems (particularly low-end systems) it makes little to no difference.  On some systems, using display lists can actually reduce performance.  This has no effect on DirectX rendering or on dynamic geometry (e.g. soft-skinned animation).
#ConfigVariable hardware-point-sprites:
  hardware-point-sprites 1  # (default value)

#Set this true to allow the use of hardware extensions when rendering perspective-scaled points and point sprites.  When false, these large points are always simulated via quads computed in software, even if the hardware claims it can support them directly.
#ConfigVariable hardware-points:
  hardware-points 1  # (default value)

#Set this true to allow the use of hardware extensions when rendering large points.  When false, large points (even if untextured) will be simulated via quads computed in software.
#ConfigVariable singular-points:
  singular-points 1  # (default value)

#Set this true to insist that when RenderModeAttrib::M_points is used, each point appears only once in the result, even if the vertex is referenced multiple times.  This is particularly important when rendering points from a triangle mesh and you don't want the points to appear repeatedly.
#ConfigVariable matrix-palette:
  matrix-palette 0  # (default value)

#Set this true to allow the use of the matrix palette when animating vertices in hardware.  The matrix palette is not supported by all devices, but if it is, using it can allow animation of more sophisticated meshes in hardware, and it can also improve the performance of animating some simpler meshes.  Without this option, certain meshes will have to be animated in software.  However, this option is not enabled by default, because its support seems to be buggy in certain drivers (ATI FireGL T2 8.103 in particular.)
#ConfigVariable display-list-animation:
  display-list-animation 0  # (default value)

#Set this true to allow the use of OpenGL display lists for rendering animated geometry (when the geometry is animated by the hardware).  This is not on by default because there appear to be some driver issues with this on my FireGL T2, but it should be perfectly doable in principle, and might get you a small performance boost.
#ConfigVariable connect-triangle-strips:
  connect-triangle-strips 1  # (default value)

#Set this true to send a batch of triangle strips to the graphics card as one long triangle strip, connected by degenerate triangles, or false to send them as separate triangle strips with no degenerate triangles.  On PC hardware, using one long triangle strip may help performance by reducing the number of separate graphics calls that have to be made.
#ConfigVariable preserve-triangle-strips:
  preserve-triangle-strips 0  # (default value)

#Set this true to indicate a preference for keeping triangle strips when possible, instead of decomposing them into triangles.  When this is true, flatten_strong and unify operations may be less effective at combining multiple Geoms together, but they will not implicitly decompose triangle strips.
#ConfigVariable dump-generated-shaders:
  dump-generated-shaders 0  # (default value)

#Set this true to cause all generated shaders to be written to disk.  This is useful for debugging broken shader generators.
#ConfigVariable cache-generated-shaders:
  cache-generated-shaders 1  # (default value)

#Set this true to cause all generated shaders to be cached in memory.  This is useful to prevent unnecessary recompilation.
#ConfigVariable enforce-attrib-lock:
  enforce-attrib-lock 1  # (default value)

#When a MaterialAttrib, TextureAttrib, or LightAttrib is constructed, the corresponding Material, Texture, or Light is 'attrib locked.'  The attrib lock prevents qualitative changes to the object.  This makes it possible to hardwire information about material, light, and texture properties into generated shaders.  This config variable can disable the attrib lock.  Disabling the lock will break the shader generator, but doing so may be necessary for backward compatibility with old code.
#ConfigVariable vertices-float64:
  vertices-float64 0  # (default value)

#When this is true, the default float format for vertices will be a 64-bit double-precision float, instead of the normal 32-bit single-precision float.  This must be set at static init time to have the broadest effect.  You almost never want to set this true, since current hardware does not support double-precision vertices, and setting this will just require the driver to downsample the vertices at load time, making everything slower.
#ConfigVariable vertex-column-alignment:
  vertex-column-alignment 4  # (default value)

#This specifies the default byte alignment for each column of data within a GeomVertexData when it is assembled using the default interfaces.  Normally, you should not change this config variable (which would change this value globally), but instead specify any alignment requirements on a per-column basis as you construct a GeomVertexFormat.  Setting this value globally could result in much needless wasted space in all vertex data objects, but it could be useful for simple experiments.  Also see vertex-animation-align-16 for a variable that controls this alignment for the vertex animation columns only.
#ConfigVariable vertex-animation-align-16:
  vertex-animation-align-16 1  # (default value)

#If this is true, then animated vertices will be created with 4-component floats and aligned to 16-byte boundaries, to allow efficient vectorization (e.g. SSE2) operations when computing animations.  If this is false, animated vertices will be packed as tightly as possible, in the normal way, which will optimize the amount of memory that must be sent to the graphics card, but prevent the use of SSE2 to calculate animation.  This does not affect unanimated vertices, which are always packed tightly.  This also impacts only vertex formats created within Panda subsystems; custom vertex formats are not affected.
#ConfigVariable textures-power-2:
  textures-power-2 none  (from )
  textures-power-2 none  (from )
  textures-power-2 down  # (default value)

#Specify whether textures should automatically be constrained to dimensions which are a power of 2 when they are loaded from disk.  Set this to 'none' to disable this feature, or to 'down' or 'up' to scale down or up to the nearest power of 2, respectively.  This only has effect on textures which are not already a power of 2.
#ConfigVariable textures-square:
  textures-square none  # (default value)

#Specify whether textures should automatically be constrained to a square aspect ratio when they are loaded from disk.  Set this to 'none', 'down', or 'up'.  See textures-power-2.
#ConfigVariable textures-auto-power-2:
  textures-auto-power-2 0  # (default value)

#If this is true, then panda will wait until you open a window, and then ask the window if it supports non-power-of-two textures. If so, then the config variable textures_power_2 will automatically be adjusted.  The pitfall of doing this is that if you then open a second window that doesn't support the same capabilities, it will have no choice but to print an error message.
#ConfigVariable textures-header-only:
  textures-header-only 0  # (default value)

#If this is true, texture images will not actually be loaded from disk, but the image header information will be consulted to verify number of channels and so forth.  The texture images themselves will be generated in a default blue color.
#ConfigVariable simple-image-size:
  simple-image-size 16 16  # (default value)

#This is an x y pair that specifies the maximum size of an automatically-generated texture simple image.  The simple image can displayed before the texture has been loaded from disk.
#ConfigVariable simple-image-threshold:
  simple-image-threshold 0.1  # (default value)

#This is a value that indicates how closely a texture's generated simple image should approximate the original image.  The smaller the number, the closer the match; small numbers will result in simple images close to the maximum size specified by simple-image-size.  Larger numbers will result in smaller simple images.  Generally the value should be considerably less than 1.
#ConfigVariable geom-cache-size:
  geom-cache-size 5000  # (default value)

#Specifies the maximum number of entries in the cache for storing pre-processed data for rendering vertices.  This limit is flexible, and may be temporarily exceeded if many different Geoms are pre-processed during the space of a single frame.
#ConfigVariable geom-cache-min-frames:
  geom-cache-min-frames 1  # (default value)

#Specifies the minimum number of frames any one particular object will remain in the geom cache, even if geom-cache-size is exceeded.
#ConfigVariable released-vbuffer-cache-size:
  released-vbuffer-cache-size 1048576  # (default value)

#Specifies the size in bytes of the cache of vertex buffers that have recently been released.  If a new vertex buffer is prepared while a recently-released one of the same size is still in the cache, that same buffer is recycled.  This cuts down on the overhead of creating and destroying vertex buffers on the graphics card.
#ConfigVariable released-ibuffer-cache-size:
  released-ibuffer-cache-size 102400  # (default value)

#Specifies the size in bytes of the cache of index buffers that have recently been released.  If a new index buffer is prepared while a recently-released one of the same size is still in the cache, that same buffer is recycled.  This cuts down on the overhead of creating and destroying index buffers on the graphics card.
#ConfigVariable default-near:
  default-near 1.0  # (default value)

#The default near clipping distance for all cameras.
#ConfigVariable default-far:
  default-far 100000.0  # (default value)

#The default far clipping distance for all cameras.
#ConfigVariable lens-far-limit:
  lens-far-limit 1e-7  # (default value)

#This number is used to reduce the effect of numeric inaccuracies in Lens::extrude().  It should be a very small, positive number, almost zero; set it larger if Lens::extrude() returns values that appear meaningless, and set it smaller if you appear to be unable to move the far plane out far enough.
#ConfigVariable default-fov:
  default-fov 30.0  # (default value)

#The default field of view in degrees for all cameras.  This is defined as a min_fov; that is, it is the field-of-view for the smallest of the X and Y sizes of the window, which is usually the vertical field of view (windows are usually wider than they are tall).  For a 4x3 window, 30 degrees vertical is roughly 40 degrees horizontal.
#ConfigVariable default-iod:
  default-iod 0.2  # (default value)

#The default interocular distance for stereo cameras.
#ConfigVariable default-converge:
  default-converge 25.0  # (default value)

#The default convergence distance for stereo cameras.
#ConfigVariable default-keystone:
  default-keystone 0.0  # (default value)

#The default keystone correction, as an x y pair, for all cameras.
#ConfigVariable vertex-save-file-directory:
  vertex-save-file-directory   # (default value)

#The directory in which the saved vertex data file is created for saving vertex buffers that have been evicted from RAM.  If this is the empty string, or an invalid directory, a system default directory will be chosen.
#ConfigVariable vertex-save-file-prefix:
  vertex-save-file-prefix p3d_vdata_  # (default value)

#A prefix used to generate the filename for the saved vertex data file which is created for saving vertex buffers that have been evicted from RAM.  A uniquifying sequence number and filename extension will be appended to this string.
#ConfigVariable vertex-data-small-size:
  vertex-data-small-size 64  # (default value)

#When a GeomVertexArrayData is this number of bytes or smaller, it is deemed too small to pay the overhead of paging it in and out, and it is permanently retained resident.
#ConfigVariable vertex-data-page-threads:
  vertex-data-page-threads 1  # (default value)

#When this is nonzero (and Panda has been compiled with thread support) then this number of sub-threads will be spawned to evict vertex pages to disk and read them back again.  When this is 0, this work will be done in the main thread, which may introduce occasional random chugs in rendering.
#ConfigVariable graphics-memory-limit:
  graphics-memory-limit -1  # (default value)

#This is a default limit that is imposed on each GSG at GSG creation time.  It limits the total amount of graphics memory, including texture memory and vertex buffer memory, that will be consumed by the GSG, regardless of whether the hardware claims to provide more graphics memory than this.  It is useful to put a ceiling on graphics memory consumed, since some drivers seem to allow the application to consume more memory than the hardware can realistically support.  Set this to -1 to have no limit other than the normal hardware-imposed limit.
#ConfigVariable sampler-object-limit:
  sampler-object-limit 2048  # (default value)

#This is a default limit that is imposed on each GSG at GSG creation time.  It limits the total amount of sampler objects that will be k.ept by the GSG, regardless of whether the hardware claims to provide more sampler objects than this. Direct3D 10-capable hardware supports at least 4096 distinct sampler objects, but we provide a slightly more conservative limit by default.
#ConfigVariable adaptive-lru-weight:
  adaptive-lru-weight 0.2  # (default value)

#Specifies the weight factor used to compute the AdaptiveLru's exponential moving average.
#ConfigVariable adaptive-lru-max-updates-per-frame:
  adaptive-lru-max-updates-per-frame 40  # (default value)

#The number of pages the AdaptiveLru class will update per frame.  Do not set this too high or it will degrade performance.
#ConfigVariable async-load-delay:
  async-load-delay 0.0  # (default value)

#If this is nonzero, it represents an artificial delay, in seconds, that is imposed on every asynchronous load attempt (within the thread).  Its purpose is to help debug errors that may occur when an asynchronous load is delayed.  The delay is per-model, and all aync loads will be queued up behind the delay--it is as if the time it takes to read a file is increased by this amount per read.
#ConfigVariable lens-geom-segments:
  lens-geom-segments 50  # (default value)

#This is the number of times to subdivide the visualization wireframe created when Lens::make_geometry() (or LensNode::show_frustum()) is called, for representing accurate curves.  Note that this is only used for a nonlinear lens such as a cylindrical or fisheye lens; for a normal perspective or orthographic lens, the wireframe is not subdivided.
#ConfigVariable stereo-lens-old-convergence:
  stereo-lens-old-convergence 0  # (default value)

#In Panda3D 1.8 and below, when using a stereo lens, Panda generate an incorrect frustum skew for a given convergence distance, meaning that the left-right images wouldn't overlap at the configured distance.  This calculation has since been corrected, but if your application relies on the old, incorrect behavior, this may be set to 'true' to switch back to the old calculation.
#ConfigVariable cg-glsl-version:
  cg-glsl-version   # (default value)

#If this is set, it forces the Cg compiler to generate GLSL code conforming to the given GLSL version when using the glslv, glslf or glslg profiles.  Use this when you are having problems with these profiles.  Example values are 120 or 150.
#ConfigVariable glsl-preprocess:
  glsl-preprocess 1  # (default value)

#If this is enabled, Panda looks for lines starting with #pragma include when loading a GLSL shader and processes it appropriately.  This can be useful if you have code that is shared between multiple shaders.  Set this to false if you have no need for this feature or if you do your own preprocessing of GLSL shaders.
#ConfigVariable glsl-include-recursion-limit:
  glsl-include-recursion-limit 10  # (default value)

#This sets a limit on how many nested #pragma include directives that Panda will follow when glsl-preprocess is enabled.  This is used to prevent infinite recursion when two shader files include each other.
#ConfigVariable max-independent-vertex-data:
  max-independent-vertex-data -1  # (default value)

#Specifies the maximum number of bytes of all vertex data that is independent of the paging system.  This is an initial buffer before max-ram-vertex-data, specifically designed for vertex datas that are dynamic in nature and may change size or be created and destroyed frequently.
#ConfigVariable vertex-data-page-size:
  vertex-data-page-size 262144  # (default value)

#The number of bytes to allocate at a time for vertex data.  This also controls the page size that is compressed or written to disk when vertex data pages are evicted from memory.
#ConfigVariable texture-minfilter:
  texture-minfilter linear  # (default value)

#This specifies the default minfilter that is applied to a texture in the absence of a specific minfilter setting.  Normally this is either 'linear' to disable mipmapping by default, or 'mipmap', to enable trilinear mipmapping by default.  This does not apply to depth textures.  Note if this variable is changed at runtime, you may need to reload textures explicitly in order to change their visible properties.
#ConfigVariable texture-magfilter:
  texture-magfilter linear  # (default value)

#This specifies the default magfilter that is applied to a texture in the absence of a specific magfilter setting.  Normally this is 'linear' (since mipmapping does not apply to magfilters).  This does not apply to depth textures.  Note if this variable is changed at runtime, you may need to reload textures explicitly in order to change their visible properties.
#ConfigVariable texture-anisotropic-degree:
  texture-anisotropic-degree 1  # (default value)

#This specifies the default anisotropic degree that is applied to a texture in the absence of a particular anisotropic degree setting (that is, a texture for which the anisotropic degree is 0, meaning the default setting).  It should be 1 to disable anisotropic filtering, or a higher number to enable it.  Note if this variable is changed at runtime, you may need to reload textures explicitly in order to change their visible properties.
#ConfigVariable texture-quality-level:
  texture-quality-level normal  # (default value)

#This specifies a global quality level for all textures.  You may specify either fastest, normal, or best.  This actually affects the meaning of Texture::set_quality_level(QL_default), so it may be overridden on a per-texture basis.  This generally only has an effect when using the tinydisplay software renderer; it has little or no effect on normal, hardware-accelerated renderers.  See Texture::set_quality_level().
#ConfigVariable max-resident-vertex-data:
  max-resident-vertex-data -1  # (default value)

#Specifies the maximum number of bytes of all vertex data that is allowed to remain resident in system RAM at one time. If more than this number of bytes of vertices are created, the least-recently-used ones will be temporarily compressed in system RAM until they are needed.  Set it to -1 for no limit.
#ConfigVariable max-compressed-vertex-data:
  max-compressed-vertex-data 0  # (default value)

#Specifies the maximum number of bytes of all vertex data that is allowed to remain compressed in system RAM at one time. If more than this number of bytes of vertices are created, the least-recently-used ones will be temporarily flushed to disk until they are needed.  Set it to -1 for no limit.
#ConfigVariable vertex-data-compression-level:
  vertex-data-compression-level 1  # (default value)

#Specifies the zlib compression level to use when compressing vertex data.  The number should be in the range 1 to 9, where larger values are slower but give better compression.
#ConfigVariable max-disk-vertex-data:
  max-disk-vertex-data -1  # (default value)

#Specifies the maximum number of bytes of vertex data that is allowed to be written to disk.  Set it to -1 for no limit.
#ConfigVariable pipeline-stages:
  pipeline-stages 1  # (default value)

#The initial number of stages in the render pipeline.  This is only meaningful if threaded pipelining is compiled into Panda.  In most cases, you should not set this at all anyway, since the pipeline can automatically grow stages as needed, but it will not remove stages automatically, and having more pipeline stages than your application requires will incur additional runtime overhead.
#ConfigVariable notify-level-linmath:
  notify-level-linmath # unspecified  (default value)

#Default severity of this notify category
#ConfigVariable paranoid-hpr-quat:
  paranoid-hpr-quat 0  # (default value)

#Set this true to doublecheck the quaternion-hpr compose and decompose operations against the quaternion-matrix and matrix-hpr operations.  This only has effect if NDEBUG is not defined.
#ConfigVariable no-singular-invert:
  no-singular-invert 0  # (default value)

#Set this true to make singular-invert warning messages generate an assertion failure instead of just a warning (which can then be trapped with assert-abort).
#ConfigVariable coordinate-system:
  coordinate-system zup_right  # (default value)

#The default coordinate system to use throughout Panda for rendering, user input, and matrix operations, unless specified otherwise.

#ConfigVariable fft-error-threshold:
  fft-error-threshold 0.2  # (default value)
#ConfigVariable bounds-type:
  bounds-type sphere  # (default value)

#Specify the type of bounding volume that is created automatically by Panda to enclose geometry.  Use 'sphere' or 'box', or use 'best' to let Panda decide which is most appropriate.  You can also use 'fastest' if you don't want Panda to waste much time computing the most optimal bounding volume.

  sgi-imagename   # (default value)

#This string is written to the header of an SGI (*.rgb) file.  It seems to have documentation purposes only.
#ConfigVariable tga-rle:

#Set this true to enable RLE compression when writing TGA files.
#ConfigVariable tga-colormap:
  tga-colormap 0  # (default value)

#Set this true to write colormapped TGA files.
#ConfigVariable tga-grayscale:
  tga-grayscale 0  # (default value)

#Set this true to enable writing grayscale TGA files.
#ConfigVariable img-header-type:
  img-header-type short  # (default value)

#IMG format is just a sequential string of r, g, b bytes.  However, it may or may not include a "header" which consists of the xsize and the ysize of the image, either as shorts or as longs.  Specify that with this variable, either 'short', 'long', or 'none' for no header at all (in which case you should also set img-size).
#ConfigVariable img-size:
  img-size 0  # (default value)

#If an IMG file without a header is loaded (e.g. img-header-type is set to 'none', this specifies the fixed x y size of the image.
#ConfigVariable jpeg-quality:
  jpeg-quality 95  # (default value)

#Set this to the quality percentage for writing JPEG files.  95 is the highest useful value (values greater than 95 do not lead to significantly better quality, but do lead to significantly greater size).
#ConfigVariable png-compression-level:
  png-compression-level 6  # (default value)

#Set this to the desired compression level for writing PNG images.  Valid values are 0 (no compression), or 1 (compression, best speed) to 9 (best compression).  Default is 6.  PNG compression is lossless.
#ConfigVariable png-palette:
  png-palette 1  # (default value)

#Set this true to allow writing palette-based PNG images when possible.
#ConfigVariable bmp-bpp:
  bmp-bpp 0  # (default value)

#This controls how many bits per pixel are written out for BMP files.  If this is zero, the default, the number of bits per pixel is based on the image.
#ConfigVariable pfm-force-littleendian:
  pfm-force-littleendian 0  # (default value)

#This forces a pfm file to be read as a sequence of little-endian floats, even if its scale factor is given as a positive number.
#ConfigVariable pfm-reverse-dimensions:
  pfm-reverse-dimensions 0  # (default value)

#Understands that the width and height of a pfm file are given backwards, in the form height width instead of width height, on input.  Does not affect output, which is always written width height.
#ConfigVariable pfm-resize-quick:
  pfm-resize-quick 1  # (default value)

#Specify true to implement PfmFile::resize() with a "quick" filter, but only when the pfm is being downsampled (to a smaller size).  This just controls the behavior of resize(); you can always call quick_filter() explicitly.
#ConfigVariable pfm-resize-gaussian:
  pfm-resize-gaussian 1  # (default value)

#Specify true to implement PfmFile::resize() with a higher-quality Gaussian filter, or false to implement it with a faster box filter.  If pfm-resize-quick is also true, this only takes effect when the pfm is being upsampled.  This just controls the behavior of resize(); you can always call box_filter() or gaussian_filter() explicitly.
#ConfigVariable pfm-resize-radius:
  pfm-resize-radius 1.0  # (default value)

#Specify the default filter radius for PfmFile::resize().  This just controls the behavior of resize(); you can always call box_filter() or gaussian_filter() explicitly with a specific radius.
#ConfigVariable notify-level-text:
  notify-level-text # unspecified  (default value)

#Default severity of this notify category
#ConfigVariable text-flatten:
  text-flatten 1  # (default value)

#Set this true to flatten text when it is generated, or false to keep it as a deep hierarchy.  Usually it's a performance advantage to keep this true, but this also depends on the setting of text-dynamic-merge.  See TextNode::set_flatten_flags().
#ConfigVariable text-dynamic-merge:
  text-dynamic-merge 1  # (default value)

#Set this true to merge generated glyphs into the GeomVertexData as the text is assembled, or false to wait for the flatten operation.  Usually it's a performance advantage to keep this true.  See TextNode::set_flatten_flags().
#ConfigVariable text-kerning:
  text-kerning 0  # (default value)

#Set this true to enable kerning when the font provides kerning tables.  This can result in more aesthetically pleasing spacing between individual glyphs.  Has no effect when text-use-harfbuzz is true, since HarfBuzz offers superior kerning support.
#ConfigVariable text-use-harfbuzz:
  text-use-harfbuzz 0  # (default value)

#Set this true to enable HarfBuzz support, which offers superior text shaping and better support for non-Latin text.
#ConfigVariable text-anisotropic-degree:
  text-anisotropic-degree 1  # (default value)

#This is the default anisotropic-degree that is set on dynamic font textures.  Setting this to a value greater than 1 can help smooth out the antialiasing for small letters.
#ConfigVariable text-texture-margin:
  text-texture-margin 2  # (default value)

#This is the number of texels of empty space reserved around each glyph in the texture.  Setting this value larger will decrease the tendency for adjacent glyphs to bleed into each other at small sizes, but it will increase amount of wasted texture memory.
#ConfigVariable text-poly-margin:
  text-poly-margin 0.0  # (default value)

#This is the amount by which to make each glyph polygon larger than strictly necessary, in screen units that are added to each margin.  Increasing this value will decrease the tendency for letters to get chopped off at the edges, but it will also increase the tendency for adjacent glyphs to bleed into each other (unless you also increase text-texture-margin).
#ConfigVariable text-page-size:
  text-page-size 256 256  # (default value)

#This is the default size for new textures created for dynamic fonts.
#ConfigVariable text-small-caps:

#ConfigVariable notify-level-bam:
  notify-level-bam # unspecified  (default value)

#Default severity of this notify category
#ConfigVariable bam-version:
  bam-version   # (default value)

#Set this to specify which version .bam files to generate.  Each Panda version only supports outputting a limited number of .bam versions.  The default is to use the latest supported version.
#ConfigVariable bam-endian:
  bam-endian littleendian  # (default value)

#The default endianness to use for writing major numeric data tables to bam files.  This does not affect all numbers written to bam files, only those for which the individual object was designed to support this flag.  The default is "native"; you may set it to "littleendian" or "bigendian" to target a particular platform.
#ConfigVariable bam-stdfloat-double:
  bam-stdfloat-double 0  # (default value)

#The default width of floating-point numbers to write to a bam file.  Set this true to force doubles (64-bit floats), or false to force singles (32-bit floats).  The default is whichever width Panda has been compiled to use natively.  Normally, this setting should not be changed from the default.
#ConfigVariable bam-texture-mode:
  bam-texture-mode relative  # (default value)

#Set this to specify how textures should be written into Bam files.See the panda source or documentation for available options.
#ConfigVariable sleep-precision:
  sleep-precision 0.01  # (default value)

#This is the accuracy within which we can expect select() to return precisely.  That is, if we use select() to request a timeout of 1.0 seconds, we can expect to actually sleep for somewhere between 1.0 and 1.0 + sleep-precision seconds.
#ConfigVariable preload-textures:
  preload-textures 1  # (default value)

#When this is true, texture images are loaded from disk as soon as the Texture is created from the TexturePool.  When this is false, the Texture is created immediately, but the image data is not loaded from disk until the Texture is actually rendered (or otherwise prepared) on the GSG.  This can help reduce wasted memory from Textures that are created but never used to render.
#ConfigVariable preload-simple-textures:
  preload-simple-textures 0  # (default value)

#When this is true, every texture image will have a simple image generated for it at load time.  (Normally, textures get a simple image at egg2bam time.)  This slows the initial loading time of textures, but allows you to take advantage of gsg::set_incomplete_render() to load textures on-the-fly in a sub-thread.  It's not generally necessary if you are loading bam files that were generated via egg2bam.
#ConfigVariable compressed-textures:
  compressed-textures 0  # (default value)

#Set this to true to compress textures as they are loaded into texture memory, if the driver supports this.  Specifically, this changes the meaning of set_compression(Texture::CM_default) to Texture::CM_on.
#ConfigVariable cache-check-timestamps:
  cache-check-timestamps 1  # (default value)

#Set this true to check the timestamps on disk (when possible) before reloading a file from the in-memory cache, e.g. via ModelPool, TexturePool, etc.  When this is false, a model or texture that was previously loaded and is still found in the ModelPool is immediately returned without consulting the disk, even if the file on disk has recently changed.  When this is true, the file on disk is always checked to ensure its timestamp has not recently changed; and if it has, the in-memory cache is automatically invalidated and the file is reloaded from disk.  This is not related to on-disk caching via model-cache-dir, which always checks the timestamps.

  audio-buffering-seconds 3.0  # (default value)

#Controls the amount of audio buffering when streaming audio. If you are playing a streaming sound, and any single frame takes longer than this, the audio will stutter.  Caution: buffering streaming audio takes a lot of memory.  For example, 5 seconds of stereo audio at 44,100 samples/sec takes one megabyte.  The 3-second default is intentionally high, favoring correctness over efficiency, but for a commercial application you may wish to lower this.
#ConfigVariable audio-preload-threshold:
  audio-preload-threshold 1000000  # (default value)

#If the decompressed size of a sound file exceeds this amount, then Panda3D will not attempt to store that sound file in RAM. Instead, it will stream the sound file from disk.  It is not practical to stream multiple sound-files from disk at the same time - the hard drive seek time makes it stutter.

It is false by default, since it is known to cause a crash with Intel 855GM driver 4.14.10.3889 at least.  Turning this on *may* reduce the chug you get for preparing display lists for the first time, by allowing the display list to be rendered at the same time it is being compiled.

#ConfigVariable gl-min-buffer-usage-hint:
  gl-min-buffer-usage-hint stream  # (default value)

#This specifies the first usage hint value that will be loaded as a vertex buffer, instead of directly from the client.  Normally, this should be "stream", which means to load the vertex buffer using GL_STREAM_DRAW.  If this is set to "dynamic", or "static", then only usage hints at that level or higher will be loaded as a vertex buffer, and stream or lower will be rendered directly from the client array.  If changing this results in a remarkable performance improvement, you may have code that is creating and destroying vertex buffers every frame, instead of reusing the same buffers.  Consider increasing released-vbuffer-cache-size instead.
#ConfigVariable gl-debug:

#Set this true to make sure that the errors generated by gl-debug are reported as soon as they happen.  This is highly recommended if you want to attach a debugger since the call stack may otherwise not point to the GL call where the error originated.
#ConfigVariable gl-debug-abort-level:
  gl-debug-abort-level fatal  # (default value)

#Set this to a setting other than 'fatal' to cause an abort to be triggered when an error of the indicated severity level (or a more severe one) occurs.  This is useful if you want to attach a debugger.  If you set this, it is highly recommended to also set gl-debug-synchronous, since the call stack will otherwise not point to the GL call that triggered the error message.  This feature is not available when NDEBUG has been defined.
#ConfigVariable gl-debug-object-labels:
  gl-debug-object-labels 1  # (default value)

#When gl-debug is set to true, this will tell OpenGL the name of textures, shaders, and other objects, so that OpenGL can display those in error messages.  There's usually no reason to disable this.
#ConfigVariable gl-debug-buffers:
  gl-debug-buffers 0  # (default value)

#Set this true, in addition to enabling debug notify for glgsg, to enable debug messages about the creation and destruction of OpenGL vertex buffers.
#ConfigVariable gl-finish:
  gl-finish 0  # (default value)

#Set this true to force a call to glFinish() after every major graphics operation.  This is likely to slow down rendering performance substantially, but it will make PStats graphs more accurately reflect where the graphics bottlenecks are, although it is better to use timer queries when available. This variable is enabled only if PStats is compiled in.
#ConfigVariable gl-force-depth-stencil:
  gl-force-depth-stencil 0  # (default value)

#Temporary hack variable 7x00 vs 8x00 nVidia bug.  See glGraphicsStateGuardian_src.cxx.
#ConfigVariable gl-force-fbo-color:
  gl-force-fbo-color 1  # (default value)

#This is set to true to force all FBOs to have at least one color attachment.  This is to work around an Intel driver issue.  Set to false to allow depth-only FBOs.
#ConfigVariable gl-check-errors:
  gl-check-errors 0  # (default value)

#Regularly call glGetError() to check for OpenGL errors.  This will slow down rendering significantly.  If your video driver supports it, you should use gl-debug instead.
#ConfigVariable gl-force-flush:
  gl-force-flush 0  # (default value)

#Call this to force a call to glFlush() after rendering a frame, even when using a double-buffered framebuffer.  This can incur a significant performance penalty.
#ConfigVariable gl-separate-specular-color:
  gl-separate-specular-color 1  # (default value)

#When separate specular mode is on, the specular component will be written to the secondary instead of the primary color, which is added after the texturing stage.  In other words, the specular highlight will be unmodulated by the color of the texture.
#ConfigVariable gl-cube-map-seamless:
  gl-cube-map-seamless 1  # (default value)

#This configures Panda to try and enable seamless cube map sampling when supported.  This will help to remove seams that show up at cube map edges, especially at lower resolutions.  On by default; disable if you suspect that this is causing problems or if you simply don't need the functionality.
#ConfigVariable gl-dump-compiled-shaders:
  gl-dump-compiled-shaders 0  # (default value)

#This configures Panda to dump the binary content of GLSL programs to disk with a filename like glsl_program0.dump into the current directory.
#ConfigVariable gl-validate-shaders:
  gl-validate-shaders 1  # (default value)

#Set this to true to enable glValidateShader the first time a shader is bound.  This may cause helpful information about shaders to be printed.
#ConfigVariable gl-immutable-texture-storage:
  gl-immutable-texture-storage 0  # (default value)

#This configures Panda to pre-allocate immutable storage for each texture.  This improves runtime performance, but changing the size or type of a texture will be slower.
#ConfigVariable gl-use-bindless-texture:
  gl-use-bindless-texture 0  # (default value)

#Set this to let Panda use OpenGL's bindless texture extension for all textures passed to shaders, for improved performance.  This is an experimental feature and comes with a few caveats; for one, it requires that all sampler uniforms have a layout(bindless_sampler) qualifier, and it also requires that the texture properties are not modified after the texture handle has been initialized.
#ConfigVariable gl-enable-memory-barriers:
  gl-enable-memory-barriers 1  # (default value)

#If this is set, Panda will make sure that every write to an image using an image2D (et al) binding will cause Panda to issue a memory barrier before the next use of said texture, to ensure that all reads and writes are properly synchronized.  This may not be strictly necessary when using the 'coherent' qualifier, but Panda has no way to detect whether you are using those.  Turning this off may give a slight performance increase, but you have to know what you're doing.
#ConfigVariable gl-vertex-array-objects:
  gl-vertex-array-objects 1  # (default value)

#Setting this causes Panda to make use of vertex array objects to more efficiently switch between sets of vertex arrays.  This only has effect when vertex-arrays and vertex-buffers are both set.  This should usually be true unless you suspect a bug in the implementation. 
#ConfigVariable gl-fixed-vertex-attrib-locations:
  gl-fixed-vertex-attrib-locations 0  # (default value)

#Experimental feature.
#ConfigVariable gl-support-primitive-restart-index:
  gl-support-primitive-restart-index 1  # (default value)

#Setting this causes Panda to make use of primitive restart indices to more efficiently render line segment primitives.  Set to false if you suspect a bug in the driver implementation.
#ConfigVariable gl-support-sampler-objects:
  gl-support-sampler-objects 1  # (default value)

#Setting this allows Panda to make use of sampler objects.  Set to false if you suspect a bug in the driver implementation.
#ConfigVariable gl-support-shadow-filter:
  gl-support-shadow-filter 1  # (default value)

#Disable this if you suspect a bug in the driver implementation of ARB_shadow.  Particularly, older ATI cards suffered from a broken implementation of the shadow map filtering features.
#ConfigVariable gl-force-image-bindings-writeonly:
  gl-force-image-bindings-writeonly 0  # (default value)

#Forces all image inputs (not textures!) to be bound as writeonly, to read from an image, rebind it as sampler.
#ConfigVariable gl-coordinate-system:
  gl-coordinate-system yup_right  # (default value)

#Which coordinate system to use as the internal coordinate system for OpenGL operations.  If you are using features like fixed-function sphere mapping, it is best to leave this to yup-right.  However, if you are creating a shader-only application, it may be easier and more efficient to set this to default.
#ConfigVariable notify-level-cocoadisplay:
  notify-level-cocoadisplay # unspecified  (default value)

#Default severity of this notify category
#ConfigVariable verify-dcast:
  verify-dcast 1  # (default value)

#Set this to true to verify that every attempted DCAST operation in fact references the correct type, or false otherwise.  This has no effect if NDEBUG is defined, in which case it is never tested.
#ConfigVariable loader-num-threads:
  loader-num-threads 1  # (default value)

#The number of threads that will be started by the Loader class to load models asynchronously.  These threads will only be started if the asynchronous interface is used, and if threading support is compiled into Panda.  The default is one thread, which allows models to be loaded one at a time in a single asychronous thread.  You can set this higher, particularly if you have many CPU's available, to allow loading multiple models simultaneously.
#ConfigVariable loader-thread-priority:
  loader-thread-priority low  # (default value)

#The default thread priority to assign to the threads created for asynchronous loading.  The default is 'low'; you may also specify 'normal', 'high', or 'urgent'.
#ConfigVariable show-scene-graph-analyzer-meter:

#ConfigVariable egg-ignore-decals:
  egg-ignore-decals 0  # (default value)
#ConfigVariable egg-flatten:
  egg-flatten 1  # (default value)

#This is normally true to flatten out useless nodes after loading an egg file.  Set it false if you want to see the complete and true hierarchy as the egg loader created it (although the extra nodes may have a small impact on render performance).
#ConfigVariable egg-flatten-radius:
  egg-flatten-radius 0.0  # (default value)

#This specifies the minimum cull radius in the egg file.  Nodes whose bounding volume is smaller than this radius will be flattened tighter than nodes larger than this radius, to reduce the node count even further.  The idea is that small objects will not need to have their individual components culled separately, but large environments should.  This allows the user to specify what should be considered "small".  Set it to 0.0 to disable this feature.
#ConfigVariable egg-unify:
  egg-unify 1  # (default value)

#When this is true, then in addition to flattening the scene graph nodes, the egg loader will also combine as many Geoms as possible within a given node into a single Geom.  This has theoretical performance benefits, especially on higher-end graphics cards, but it also slightly slows down egg loading.
#ConfigVariable egg-combine-geoms:
  egg-combine-geoms 0  # (default value)

#Set this true to combine sibling GeomNodes into a single GeomNode, when possible.  This usually shouldn't be necessary, since the egg loader does a pretty good job of combining these by itself.
#ConfigVariable egg-rigid-geometry:
  egg-rigid-geometry 0  # (default value)

#Set this true to create rigid pieces of an animated character as separate static nodes, or false to leave these in with the parent node as vertex-animated geometry.  Setting this true means less geometry has to be vertex-animated, but there will tend to be more separate pieces.
#ConfigVariable egg-flat-shading:
  egg-flat-shading 0  # (default value)

#Set this true to allow the egg loader to create geometry with the ShadeModelAttrib::M_flat attribute set.  It will do this only for geometry that has per-polygon normals and/or colors.  This allows the egg loader to avoid duplicating vertices when they are shared between connected polygons with different normals or colors, but it prevents the flat-shaded geometry from being combined with any adjacent smooth-shaded geometry (for instance, as the result of a flatten_strong operation).  It is false by default, since flat-shaded geometry is rare; but you may wish to set it true if your scene largely or entirely consists of flat-shaded polygons.
#ConfigVariable egg-flat-colors:
  egg-flat-colors 1  # (default value)

#Set this true to allow the egg loader to create geometry with the ColorAttrib::T_flat attribute set: that is, geometry that uses the scene graph color instead of per-vertex color.  Normally Panda will do this as an optimization for Geoms whose vertices are all the same color, or all white.  This allows the removal of the color attribute from the vertices where it is not necessary to specify colors per-vertex.  If this is false, the color attribute will always be specified per-vertex, even if all vertices have the same value.
#ConfigVariable egg-load-old-curves:
  egg-load-old-curves 1  # (default value)

#When this is true, a <NurbsCurve> entry appearing in an egg file will load as a NurbsCurve or ClassicNurbsCurve object (see below). When this is false, it will load a RopeNode instead, which uses the new NurbsCurveEvaluator interface.
#ConfigVariable egg-load-classic-nurbs-curves:
  egg-load-classic-nurbs-curves 0  # (default value)

#When this is true (and the above is also true), a <NurbsCurve> entry appearing in an egg file will load a ClassicNurbsCurve object instead of the default, a NurbsCurve object.  This only makes a difference when the NURBS++ library is available, in which case the default, NurbsCurve, is actually a NurbsPPCurve object.
#ConfigVariable egg-accept-errors:
  egg-accept-errors 1  # (default value)

#When this is true, certain kinds of recoverable errors (not syntax errors) in an egg file will be allowed and ignored when an egg file is loaded.  When it is false, only perfectly pristine egg files may be loaded.
#ConfigVariable egg-suppress-hidden:
  egg-suppress-hidden 0  # (default value)

#When this is true, objects flagged as "hidden" with the visibility scalar are not created at all.  When false, these objects are created, but initially stashed.
#ConfigVariable egg-alpha-mode:
  egg-alpha-mode blend  # (default value)

#Specifies the alpha mode to apply when the alpha specification "on" appears in the egg file (or when a primitive is implicitly transparent, because of a <RGBA> that involves a non-unity alpha, or because of a four-channel texture.
#ConfigVariable egg-max-vertices:
  egg-max-vertices 65534  # (default value)

#Specifies the maximum number of vertices that will be added to any one GeomVertexData by the egg loader.
#ConfigVariable egg-max-indices:
  egg-max-indices 65535  # (default value)

#Specifies the maximum number of vertex indices that will be added to any one GeomPrimitive by the egg loader.
#ConfigVariable egg-emulate-bface:
  egg-emulate-bface 1  # (default value)

#When this is true, the bface flag applied to a polygon will cause two different polygons to be created, back-to-back.  When it is false, a single polygon will be created with the two_sided flag set on it.
#ConfigVariable egg-preload-simple-textures:
  egg-preload-simple-textures 1  # (default value)

#This specifies whether the egg loader will generate simple texture images for each texture loaded.  This supercedes the preload-simple-textures global default, for egg files.  In fact, the egg loader will generate simple texture images if either this or preload-simple-textures is true.
#ConfigVariable egg-vertex-membership-quantize:
  egg-vertex-membership-quantize 0.1  # (default value)

#Specifies the nearest amount to round each vertex joint membership value when loading an egg file.  This affects animated egg files only.  There is a substantial runtime performance advantage for reducing trivial differences in joint membership.  Set this to 0 to leave joint membership as it is.
#ConfigVariable egg-vertex-max-num-joints:
  egg-vertex-max-num-joints 4  # (default value)

#Specifies the maximum number of distinct joints that are allowed to control any one vertex.  If a vertex requests assignment to more than this number of joints, the joints with the lesser membership value are ignored.  Set this to -1 to allow any number of joints.
#ConfigVariable egg-implicit-alpha-binary:
  egg-implicit-alpha-binary 0  # (default value)

#If this is true, then a <Scalar> alpha value appearing in an egg file that appears to specify only a binary (0 or 1) value for alpha will automatically be downgraded to alpha type "binary" instead of whatever appears in the egg file.
#ConfigVariable notify-level-egg:
  notify-level-egg # unspecified  (default value)

#Default severity of this notify category
#ConfigVariable egg-support-old-anims:
  egg-support-old-anims 1  # (default value)

#Set this true to support loading of old character animation files, which had the convention that the order "phr" implied a reversed roll.
#ConfigVariable egg-mesh:
  egg-mesh 1  # (default value)

#Set this true to convert triangles and higher-order polygons into triangle strips and triangle fans when an egg file is loaded or converted to bam.  Set this false just to triangulate everything into independent triangles.
#ConfigVariable egg-retesselate-coplanar:
  egg-retesselate-coplanar 0  # (default value)

#If this is true, the egg loader may reverse the tesselation direction of a single pair of planar triangles that share the same properties, if that will help get a better triangle strip.  In some rare cases, doing so can distort the UV's on a face; turning this off should eliminate that artifact (at the cost of less-effective triangle stripping).
#ConfigVariable egg-unroll-fans:
  egg-unroll-fans 1  # (default value)

#Set this true to allow the egg loader to convert weak triangle fans--triangles that share the same vertex but aren't connected enough to justify making a triangle fan primitive from them--into a series of zig-zag triangles that can make a triangle strip that might connect better with its neighbors.
#ConfigVariable egg-show-tstrips:
  egg-show-tstrips 0  # (default value)

#Set this true to color each triangle strip a random color, with the leading triangle a little bit darker, so you can visually observe the quality of the triangle stripping algorithm.
#ConfigVariable egg-show-qsheets:
  egg-show-qsheets 0  # (default value)

#Set this true to color each quadsheet a random color, so you can visually observe the quadsheet algorithm.
#ConfigVariable egg-show-quads:
  egg-show-quads 0  # (default value)

#Set this true to color each detected quad a random color, so you can visually observe the algorithm that unifies pairs of triangles into quads (prior to generating triangle strips).
#ConfigVariable egg-subdivide-polys:
  egg-subdivide-polys 1  # (default value)

#This is obsolete.  In the old Geom implementation, it used to be true to force higher-order polygons that were not otherwise meshed to be subdivided into triangles.  In the new Geom implementation, this happens anyway.
#ConfigVariable egg-consider-fans:
  egg-consider-fans 0  # (default value)

#Set this true to enable the egg mesher to consider making triangle fans out of triangles that are connected at a common vertex.  This may help if your scene involves lots of such connected triangles, but it can also make the overall stripping less effective (by interfering with triangle strips).
#ConfigVariable egg-max-tfan-angle:
  egg-max-tfan-angle 40.0  # (default value)

#The maximum average angle per triangle to allow in a triangle fan.  If triangles are larger than this--that is, more loosely packed--then we figure a triangle strip is likely to do a more effective job than a triangle fan, and the fan maker leaves it alone.
#ConfigVariable egg-min-tfan-tris:
  egg-min-tfan-tris 4  # (default value)

#The minimum number of triangles that must be involved in order to generate a triangle fan.  Fewer than this is just interrupting a triangle strip.
#ConfigVariable egg-coplanar-threshold:
  egg-coplanar-threshold 0.01  # (default value)

#The numerical threshold below which polygons are considered to be coplanar.  Determined empirically.
#ConfigVariable egg-test-vref-integrity:
  egg-test-vref-integrity 20  # (default value)

#The maximum number of vertices a primitive may have before its vertices will no longer be checked for internal integrity.  This is meaningful in non-production builds only.
#ConfigVariable egg-recursion-limit:
  egg-recursion-limit 1000  # (default value)

#The maximum number of levels that recursive algorithms within the egg library are allowed to traverse.  This is a simple hack to prevent deeply-recursive algorithms from triggering a stack overflow.  Set it larger to run more efficiently if your stack allows it; set it lower if you experience stack overflows.
#ConfigVariable egg-precision:
  egg-precision 15  # (default value)

#The number of digits of precision to write out for values in an egg file.  Leave this at 0 to use the default setting for the stream.
#ConfigVariable notify-level-ptloader:
  notify-level-ptloader # unspecified  (default value)

#Default severity of this notify category
#ConfigVariable ptloader-units:
  ptloader-units invalid  # (default value)

#Specifies the preferred units into which models will be converted when using libptloader to automatically convert files to Panda at load time, via e.g. "pview myMayaFile.mb".
#ConfigVariable ptloader-load-node:
  ptloader-load-node 1  # (default value)

#Specify true to allow libptloader to invoke the more efficient but possibly-experimental code to load model files directly into PandaNode when possible.  Specify false to force the loading to always go through the egg library, which is more likely to be reliable.
#ConfigVariable notify-level-flt:
  notify-level-flt # unspecified  (default value)

#Default severity of this notify category
#ConfigVariable flt-error-abort:
  flt-error-abort 0  # (default value)

#Set this true to trigger an assertion failure (and core dump) immediately when an error is detected on reading or writing a flt file.  This is primarily useful for debugging the flt reader itself, to generate a stack trace to determine precisely at what point a flt file failed.

#If this is set to true, compressed textures will be cached in the model cache, in their compressed form as downloaded by the GSG.  This may be set in conjunction with model-cache-textures, or it may be independent.
#ConfigVariable model-cache-compiled-shaders:
